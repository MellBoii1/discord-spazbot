# Discord - SpazBot
The code for SpazBot, a discord bot for [BombSquda](https://github.com/MellBoii1/bombsquda) with a variety of random commands.
Not like any other [SpazBot](https://bombsquad.fandom.com/wiki/Bot), this one's for discord! (obviously) <br>
This discord bot introduces a few commands that can be used for fun 
(gambling, grinding, robbing, etc.. dank memer stuff), interacting with some BombSquda stuff,
general commands, and anything else that may be added in future updates/commits!
## So, how do I run it?
First, make a .env file that has these tags:
```
TOKEN='MYBOTTOKENHERE'
PREFIX='sb!'
PREFIX2='spazbot, '
STATUS_CHANNEL_ID='0'
```
You may edit the prefixes to your liking. However,
you **MUST** supply your own bot token 
as you have make the bot yourself. It's no hassle tho!
Also, the status channel ID is where the bot will send the status of the 
[BombSquda Server](https://github.com/MellBoii1/bombsquda-server).
